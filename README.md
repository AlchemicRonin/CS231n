# CS231n Assignments Solutions Spring 2020

The last weeks I have been following the course of Stanford [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) and this repository is a compilation of my solutions for the assignments proposed on the course.

In each folder you will find a README.md file with the instructions for the assignments, the same that you can find on the page of the course. I totally recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete the assignments!  

###  Assignment 1

* [k-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/israfelsr/cs231n-2019/blob/master/assignment1/knn.ipynb)

* [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/israfelsr/cs231n-2019/blob/master/assignment1/svm.ipynb)

* [Softmax Classifier](https://github.com/israfelsr/cs231n-2019/blob/master/assignment1/softmax.ipynb)

* [Two-Layer Neural Network](https://github.com/israfelsr/cs231n-2019/blob/master/assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb)

* [Image Features](https://github.com/israfelsr/cs231n-2019/blob/master/assignment1/features.ipynb)


### Assignment 2

- [Fully Connected Networks]()
- [Batch Normalization]()
- [Dropout]()
- [Convolutional Networks]()
- [Tensorflow]()
- [Pytorch]()

### Assignment 3



I also write an article on my blog about some of the topics touched by this course.
[Understanding Batch, Layer and Group Normalization]().
